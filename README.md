# Exploring a Minimal 2D Simulation of a Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot

Welcome to the exercise worksheets!  All of these worksheets are intended to be used interactively within <a href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory/">Google Colab</a>.  You should be able to save them into your own workspace.  You may need a <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">Google account</a> to do so.

## Info: Getting Started

If you have not used Python of Google Colab before, the following exercise sheets will help you to get started:

### [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paulodowd/GoogleColab_Simple2DSimulator/blob/main/01_Operators.ipynb) Python: Operators 
Performing basic calculations, Making comparisons between variables, Using comparisons and other Boolean True or False values to form logic statements.

### [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paulodowd/GoogleColab_Simple2DSimulator/blob/main/02_Control_Flow.ipynb) Python: Control Flow
Making decisions within a program to direct the flow of the program execution.
    
### [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/paulodowd/GoogleColab_Simple2DSimulator/blob/main/03_Loops.ipynb) Python: Loops
Controllably repeating operations within a program. 
    
### [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) Google Colab 
Colaboratory, or 'Colab' for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with Zero configuration required, Free access to GPUs, & Easy sharing.  Whether you're a student, a data scientist or an AI researcher, Colab can make your work easier.

      In this worksheet we will develop a controller to make decisions for the simulated robot.  You can investigate using python to read the simulated sensors and to steer the robot away from obstructions.

    <td>
      In this worksheet we will develop a more advanced controller for the simulated robot.  You can write behaviours for the robot to discover an obstruction and then to control the simulated robot to navigate around the obstruction at close proximity.

    <td>
      In this worksheet we will combine previous work to record a map of the simulated environment.  You will need to develop a strategy and an advance controller to explore the environment efficiently.
    </td>
  </tr>

In this worksheet we will learn about the variability of sensor readings and how to create a simple model of this in our minimal simulator.  You can then update your simulator and controller in worksheet 1.

## Day 5: Explore!

We've kept this day free of a new exercise sheet so that you can explore any of the previous sheets and take them further if you wish.  You'll be able to ask for support on any related questions during the teaching session.
