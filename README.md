# Exploring a Minimal 2D Simulation of Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot

Welcome to the exercise worksheets!  All of these worksheets are intended to be used interactively within <a href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory/">Google Colab</a>.  You should be able to save them into your own workspace.  You will need a <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">Google account</a> to do so.

If you have not used Python or Google Colab before, it will be useful to read this worksheet.

      In this worksheet we will develop a controller to make decisions for the simulated robot.  You can investigate using python to read the simulated sensors and to steer the robot away from obstructions.
    </td>
  </tr>

    <td>
      In this worksheet we will develop a more advanced controller for the simulated robot.  You can write behaviours for the robot to discover an obstruction and then to control the simulated robot to navigate around the obstruction at close proximity.

    <td>
      In this worksheet we will combine previous work to record a map of the simulated environment.  You will need to develop a strategy and an advance controller to explore the environment efficiently.
    </td>
  </tr>
 </table>

## Day 4: ???
In this worksheet we will learn about the variability of sensor readings and how to create a simple model of this in our minimal simulator.  You can then update your simulator and controller in worksheet 1.

## Day 5: ???




In this worksheet we will learn about a more realistic response from a sensor used in robotics.  We will consider how to model a real sensor in our minimal 2D simulator.  You can then update your simulator and update your controller in worksheet 1.
