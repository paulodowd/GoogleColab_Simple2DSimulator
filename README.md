# Exploring a Minimal 2D Simulation of Two-Wheeled Mobile Robot

Welcome to the exercise worksheets!  All of these worksheets are intended to be used interactively within <a href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory/">Google Colab</a>.  You should be able to save them into your own workspace.  You will need a <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">Google account</a> to do so.

      In this worksheet we will develop a controller to make decisions for the simulated robot.  You can investigate using python to read the simulated sensors and to steer the robot away from obstructions.

      In this worksheet we will develop a more advanced controller for the simulated robot.  You can discovering an obstruction and then controlling the simulated robot to navigated around the obstruction at close proximity.

In this worksheet we will learn about the variability of sensor readings and how to create a simple model of this in our minimal simulator.  You can then update your simulator and controller in worksheet 1.

## Day 4: ???

## Day 5: ???




In this worksheet we will learn about a more realistic response from a sensor used in robotics.  We will consider how to model a real sensor in our minimal 2D simulator.  You can then update your simulator and update your controller in worksheet 1.
