# GoogleColab_Simple2DSimulator

Welcome to the exercise worksheets!

## Day 1: A Minimal 2D Simulator

In this worksheet we will develop a controller to make decisions for the robot.  You can investigate using python to read the simulated sensors and to steer the robot away from obstructions.

## Day 2: Sensor Response

In this worksheet we will learn about a more realistic response from a sensor used in robotics.  We will consider how to model a real sensor in our minimal 2D simulator.  You can then update your simulator and update your controller in worksheet 1.
